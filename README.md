## Lab 1 - Point cloud filtering and Clustering with Open3D
For this lab assignment we are given a data set with several LiDAR scans from an autonomous vehicle. Our tasks are, to separate the points corresponding to ground and obstacles, and then implement bounding boxes on the obstacles.
For the first task, the first step is to downsample the voxel size and implement python functions to separate the points that correspond to the ground from those that correspond to obstacles. This is done by implementing a threshold on the height of the points (Z coordinates) and on their normal vector direction. Lastly, we remove the points corresponding to the autonomous vehicle itself (mainly the roof, hood and trunk) by implementing a simple threshold on the point's eucledian norm.
For the second task, we use Open3D functions to cluster the points based on the radius of the neighbourhood and the minimum number of points of the cluster (tuned by trial and error).
Lastly, Open3D functions are used to trace the bounding boxes around the relevant objects. Giving a threshold for dimensions of the box allows for less relevant obstacles (i.e. buildings) to be discarded.
